            How Sairam Education Started
          </h2>

          <p className=" mb-4 font-Regular text-[16px] md:text-[18px] text-[#696984] tracking-[0.02em]">
           Sairam Education was established in 2006 with the objective of supporting students in making informed academic decisions. Founded by Ankit, the organization was built on the belief that the right guidance at the right time can significantly influence a student’s academic and professional future.
What began as a focused counseling initiative gradually evolved into a comprehensive education consultancy, assisting students across diverse disciplines and admission pathways. Over the years, Sairam Education has continued to strengthen its counseling framework, institutional relationships, and student support systems.
